# Vulindlela-VoiceNavigation [CONCEPT]
Incomplete Voice navigation and control concept to be part integrated to drivemode, to make it easier to create traffic alerts and respond to alarms without taking the hands off the wheel or being distracted from driving.

## Contents
- Includes the main voice command page, meant to be merged into the project drive mode and main client, to allow for users to give commands and use the app, e.g. create an alert, startup the dash and maybe save and end dashcam recording.

## Project Startup
- Build C# code, navigate to the bin folder and run the .exe file.

## Regards
This is a rough concept, with a lot of room for improvement, project is not in progress or in use, but the concepts and ideas are still valid, so any suggestions would be appreciated.
